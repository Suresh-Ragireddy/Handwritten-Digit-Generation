# Handwritten Digit Generation using GANs

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate images of handwritten digits. The GAN is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The architecture includes a generator network that learns to create realistic digit images and a discriminator network that distinguishes between real and generated images.

## Introduction

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Goodfellow et al. in 2014. This project demonstrates the power of GANs by training a model to generate realistic handwritten digit images from random noise. The GAN consists of two neural networks:

- **Generator:** Generates synthetic images resembling handwritten digits.
- **Discriminator:** Evaluates images to distinguish between real (from the dataset) and fake (generated) images.

Through the adversarial process, both networks improve over time, leading to the generation of highly realistic digit images.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need the following software and libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the implementation)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas (optional for data handling)

### Installation

1. Set up Python and install the required libraries.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HandwrittenNumberGAN.git
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd HandwrittenNumberGAN
4. Install dependencies (you may need to uncomment and run the appropriate command for your OS in the notebook):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook HandwrittenNumberGAN.ipynb

## Usage

1. Open the `HandwrittenNumberGAN.ipynb` notebook.
2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to run the GAN training process.
3. After training, the notebook will generate samples of handwritten digits, visualizing the results of the generator's output.

## Results

During training, you will observe that the generated images become increasingly similar to real handwritten digits. The provided notebook includes visualizations of these generated images at various stages of the training process, demonstrating the improvement in quality over time.
