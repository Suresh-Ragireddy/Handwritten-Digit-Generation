# Handwritten-Digit-Generation
Developed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to create realistic handwritten digit images using the MNIST dataset. This project involved training a generator to produce digit images and a discriminator to distinguish them from real ones, enhancing image quality and authenticity through adversarial learning.
