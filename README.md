# **Handwritten Digit Generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**

- Developed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using TensorFlow/PyTorch to generate realistic handwritten digit images based on the MNIST dataset.
- Implemented and fine-tuned both generator and discriminator neural network architectures, optimizing model performance and stability.
- Conducted data preprocessing and normalization of input datasets to enhance training efficiency and model accuracy.
- Analyzed and visualized generated output using Matplotlib, demonstrating the improvement in image quality over training epochs.
